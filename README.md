# TRN Builders - Web Development Project

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

TRN Builders is a web development project designed to create a dynamic, user-friendly website for a construction company. The website showcases their services and provides an engaging experience to visitors. The main objective was to create a professional, interactive platform that reflects the companyâ€™s commitment to excellence in the construction industry.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **Modern Login Page**: Secure login system for easy access to the platform.
- **Dynamic Carousel**: Showcasing services like construction, painting, carpentry, and more.
- **Interactive Service Cards**: Highlighting the core values of the company, such as quality and expertise.
- **Responsive Contact Form Modal**: A form that enables visitors to inquire about services or ask questions directly.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

The following technologies were used to develop the website:

- **HTML**: For structuring the website content.
- **CSS**: For styling and visual layout.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity and dynamic elements to the site.
- **Bootstrap 5**: A mobile-first framework for responsive, mobile-friendly design.
- **jQuery**: For handling dynamic actions, such as carousel functionality and modal animations.

## ðŸ’¡ Challenges

During the development of this project, I faced a few challenges that helped me grow as a developer:

- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the website looks great on all devices by leveraging Bootstrap's grid system and custom media queries.
- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Smoothly loading dynamic content (carousel, service cards) while maintaining fast performance.
- **Modal Implementation**: Ensuring form validation worked correctly and debugging the modal functionality across multiple browsers.
